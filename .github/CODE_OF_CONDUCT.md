# Code of Conduct

The Hanual langauge is designed to help software development. We don't want to micro-manage the community and say do this
do that. We don't mind whatever attitude the comunity takes, whether it becomes eliteist or a simple community we don't
mind. However I do want that the comunity respects and adhears to the following rules:

1. Do not try to brand your own project as official or 'the best' without reason. This is to protect official Hanual
   software and work. A library or framework can ern that title if it is recognized by the project, but this is only if we
   give the authors explicit notice.
2. Do not try and dammage the reputation of the project.
3. Do not use the project as a way to spread malware or any of it's varients. This is to prevent users from creating a PR
   that knowingly creates a vulnerability or explot.
4. Do not infringe on other people's IP (interlectual property) anything that is public domain should be treated as such, however,
   credit must be given to the authors unless said otherwise.
