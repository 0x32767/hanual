# The Official Hanual Language Documentation

## What is Hanual

Hanual is a programing langauge developed by two secondary school (middle school in US) students. The language aims to simplifiy cross platform low level computing problems. This is done by using a runtime environment. Unlike most other languages which do this, hanual will still aim to implement mallocs, frees and pointers. The aim of this is to allow a programmer to use lowish level computing but be able to do it on a wide range of hardware.

## Aims of Hanual

We want hanual to be a fast, intermediate level language. Hanual syntatically has a widely understood syntax with curly braces. And is also compiled, allowing users to experience the pain of linking libruaries (last part was a joke). Unlike manny midlevel languages hanual tries to be as simple as possible and remove (argually) unnecessery abstractions like classes.

## Philosophies of Hanual developement

Hanual mimics manny philiosophies of large projects like linux and touhou. Both, aim to create work that is free and transparent. This project is open source so anyone can see what is going on under the hood. And hanual provides a tool that can be used by manny to achive amazing stuff. However, I will implement some rules that users do need to follow, these rules don't aim to supress creativity or use but aim to uphold the language's reputation, legitimacy and preserve official work. We don't want a group of prople forking our language and brand it as the "real official Hanual languge", this would cause confusion in the community, not epic.

## Philosophies of the Hanual language

We belive strongly in backwards compatability and choice. We want users to create their own runtime and even compiler if they want to. Infact the language is so strong on this front that I have made the parsing libruary my self. You can also check the requirements.txt to see that the language require to function. The langauge wants to have a universally understandable syntax, be simple enough for anyone to adopt and have easey readable code. We have removed classes for this specific purpose. We want users to be explicit in their code, this makes it easy for users to pickup where someone left off.
